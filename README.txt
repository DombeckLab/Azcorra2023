"# Azcorra2023" 

Azcorra, Gaertner et al. Nat Neuro 2023 custom code.

This repository includes all custom code used to analyze data in our manuscript (Azcorra, Gaertner et al. Nat Neuro 2023), in two folders:

1) "Fiber photometry data analysis" - we analyzed a large single-nucleus RNAseq dataset of midbrain dopamine neurons in order to establish subtypes, look at DEGs, and explore relationships between clusters. In the associated R script file, custom code necessary for the RNAseq analyses in the paper are provided.

2) "Single-nucleus RNAseq data analysis" - we analyzed fiber photometry recordings from head-fixed mice running on a treadmill while receiving rewards and aversive air puffs in order to analyze differences or similarities in functional responses of different subtypes of striatonigral dopamine neurons. Custom code necessary fiber photometry data pre-processing (bleaching correction, DF/F calculation, behavioral parsing...) and for data analysis/figure generation in the paper are provided.

More information on each of these code sets is available in the corresponding README files inside each folder.
